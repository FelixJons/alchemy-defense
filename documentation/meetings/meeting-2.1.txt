1. Meeting Agenda.
	Group: HandyMen
	Date: 6/9/2021
	Chair: Willem Brahmstaedt
	Participants: Felix JÃ¶nsson, Johan Linden, Valdemar Stenhammar, Willem Brahmstaedt.

2. Objectives.
	- Minor possible issues with Maven setup.
	- The group is confused about some of the terminology and distincitions used in the course.

3. Reports.
	- The group decided upon to make use of the game development framework libGDX. This was the most widely used
	  framework with regards to game development and seems to great documentation and a user friendly API. 
	- An initial git repository has been made.
	- The game should have a pixel art style. This will allow the group to invest minimal time in both programming 
	  relating to the applications graphics and the actual production of the art, while still a good looking game.

4. Discussion items.
	- Decide upon a programming style which the group should follow to produce a cohesive code body.
	- Generate user stories.
	- Sketch up a rough GUI.
	- Establish a common understanding of the terminology used in the course.


5. Outcomes and assignments.
	- Refined user stories by categorising epics and breaking them up into more manageable and concrete stories.
	- Identified the user stories with higest priorities. 
	- Created a SCRUM board. 
	- Produced a first draft of the GUI. << KLISTRA IN BILD >> 
	- Created a text file that defines a unified definition of different terms used by the group.
	- Willem will try to setup Maven with the libGDX framework. 
	- Every team member should do some research into the API of libGDX to get a basic understanding of the framework.

6. Wrap up.
	- There is still some confusion about the difference between "Acceptance Criteria" and "Definition of Done". The
	  group members will do some further research regarding this and then write out the definition for each term in the groups
	  unified definition document.
