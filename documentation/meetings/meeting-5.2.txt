    - Assign new taks to team members. 

3. Reports.

    - Valdemar has added the possiblity to sell and buy towers, has also refactored how you buy towers in the code. Added tower view
 	to make it possible to sell "ingame".

    - Felix has updated positionalCell so that you only can add one tower in every cell, has also started to refactor point to our
	class.

    - Willem has continued to write javadocs. 

    - Johan has implemented an endgoal for the game that works with foes so that for every foe that reaches the endgoal the player
	loses health. 

4. Discussion items.

    - How we can select a tower from the grid and get that specific object to use in code?

    - Rewrite definition of done?
	
    - Create two different updates loops for the rendering and the model?	 

    - Might have to write who authored what class after reading through SSD document. 

    - Adjust the code so that the game can scale and adapt to different screen sizes. 


5. Outcomes and assignments.

    - We will now write who authored what class but not when it was modified. 

    - Fix the definition of done in trello so that it is the same as in our RAD, the correct version.

    - Create an animation loop specifically for the view and one for the model so we can update in different frequency.

    - This meeting is on friday and no assigments were given over the weekend. 



6. Wrap up.

    - Multiple foes should be able to be on the same cell. Atm only the last foe to a cell remains, the rest disappear. (Same as last meeting, not fixed yet)

    - Create tests for endgoal and buy/sell towers.

    - Have a nice weekend.
