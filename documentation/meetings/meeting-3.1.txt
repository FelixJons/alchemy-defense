1. Meeting Agenda.
	Group: HandyMen
	Date: 13/9/2021
	Chair: Valdemar Stenhammar
	Participants: Felix Jönsson, Johan Linden, Valdemar Stenhammar, Willem Brahmstaedt.

2. Objectives.
  - Create a clean and correct UML-diagram of the domain model to use for the seminar on
    Tuesday, 09-14.
    
  - Create a simple runnable version of the application based on the UML-diagram created during
    Friday the 10:th meeting.
    
  - Switch from from Maven to Gradle since Gradle is preferred when using libGDX.
  
  - Assign each member a responsibility to have over the code.


3. Reports.
  Since last meeting took place on Friday the 10:th and this meeting takes place on Monday the
  13:th, no assignments were given during the weekend.


4. Discussion items.
  - Decide where in the project the game loop should be implemented.
  
  - Decide how the ”board-grid” should be implemented, i.e. whether to use the applications
    coordinates or a grid with larger cells, or a combination of both to represent the positions of
    towers and foes.

5. Outcomes and assignments.
  - The game loop was decided to be implemented within the controller module since that is what
    gives directions to the model and it is therefore logical that that’s also where the looping is
    handled.
    
  - The ”board-grid” was decided to use a combination of both the applications coordinates and
   a grid with large cells in order to represent the positioning of objects on the board. The
   coordinates will be used to represent the foes position which will allow the foes to move
   ”smoothly” over the board while the grid will allow a tower, that is always stationary, to
   easily be placed in one cell.
   
  - Since the UML-diagram was not entirely done Johan will add the finishing touches for it to
    be ready for Tuesdays seminar.
    
  - No coding was done during this meeting, but each members responsibilities were decided and
    until next meeting some coding should be done in order to be able to have a runnable version
    this week.

6. Wrap up.
  - Discuss whether a more accurate prototype of the GUI should be created in e.g. Figma.
  
  - Next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at 13:15.
