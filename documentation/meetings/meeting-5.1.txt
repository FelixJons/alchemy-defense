2. Objectives.

    - Continue with refining user stories

    - Assign new tasks to team members

3. Reports.

    - Valdemar has begun refining each user story and sorted them. Implemented the removal of foes
    that no longer are alive. Refactored code. Started implementing a new pathfinding.

    - Johan added UML, user stories and introduction to RAD

    - Felix has refined the SSD, added new a UML-project diagram and a updated our class diagram

    - Willem has refactored code and written tests more tests that also check the 'connection' between objects

4. Discussion items.

    - Discussed how we shall document our code

    - Are the user stories in Trello in the correct section? I.e. are many of them really completed?

5. Outcomes and assignments.

    - We will no longer write in the Java docs how authored what class, and then who modified what. Instead we will
    only explain our code and let the accountability rest on git commits.

    - Moved the user stories from completed to tested, since they do not yet fulfill our definition of done.

    - Ask our supervisor if tests are needed for view classes and if the application is expected to be able to adapt
    to different screen sizes.

    - Valdemar implements functionality for gold usage.

    - Felix updates TileView so it can hold multiple images and changes the way PositionalCell handles Towers and Foes.

    - Johan adds functionality so that the player takes damage when a foe reaches goal.

    - Willem writes Java doc for the classes from user stories which are in the testing column, so that they can be moved to
    the completed column. Continue writing tests.

6. Wrap up.

	- Multiple foes should be able to be on the same cell. Atm only the last foe to a cell remains, the rest disappear.

	- If one wants to add a tower on a cell where there already is a foe one gets a plethora of error messages.

	- Next meeting: Friday 01-10-2021 at 9:30.
